description: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the United
  States government agency that is responsible for the civilian space program as well
  as for aeronautics and aerospace research. President Dwight D. Eisenhower established
  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958[5] with a distinctly
  civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in
  space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958,
  disestablishing NASAs predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
  (NACA).
